Primary producers {#lnk_primaer}
=================

The lowest level of the food web consists of primary producers, which obtain 
their energy from light and use this energy to bind CO_2 and build up biomass. 
In the process, oxygen is released into the water.

The largest proportion of primary producers in flowing waters is usually the 
phytoplankton. This group, which is often simplified as *algae*
forms an important nutritional basis for higher trophic levels such as 
zooplankton or fish. However, algae can also cause problems if they when they 
grow in masses and their biomass no longer can be utilised. 
In such a case, the algal biomass is degraded, consuming oxygen, 
so that very low oxygen concentrations can occur in the water. 

In QSim, there are several primary producers that carry out photosynthesis: 
- pelagic phytoplankton: \subpage lnk_phytoplankton
- benthic algae: \subpage lnk_albenth
- macrophytes: \subpage lnk_makrophyt
