The model application can be devided into three parts:
- Preprocessing: \subpage lnk_modellerstellung 
- Processing: \subpage lnk_programmstart

Examples of model applications can be found in the sub-chapter 
\subpage lnk_validierung .

Sometimes it happens that things don't work the way they should.
