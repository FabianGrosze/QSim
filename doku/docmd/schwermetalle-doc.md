Heavy metals {#lnk_schwermetalle}
=================

The importance of heavy metals for water pollution control lies in the many 
harmful effects that many of them have on the aquatic biology and, via the 
drinking water, on other biotic communities, including humans. 
Some metals are highly toxic even in low concentrations, and many are highly 
bioaccumulative.

On the other hand, many heavy metals belong to the group of essential trace 
elements, i.e., plant and animal life is not possible without them.

Heavy metals are neither biologically nor abiotically degradable. 
They occur in water both dissolved and adsorbed to solids. 
In dissolved form, they are almost exclusively subject to transport in 
running water. The uptake of small amounts by aquatic organisms is neglected 
here.

Water and suspended matter are thus the main media for the transport of heavy 
metals in rivers. 

The explanations presented in this documentation refer to the metalloid arsenic, 
which, for the sake of simplicity, is also subsumed under the generic term 
"heavy metals".
