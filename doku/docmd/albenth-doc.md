Benthic algae {#lnk_albenth}
================

\warning The module is currently switched off, i.e. benthic algae are not 
simulated. This is an old documentation.

In QSim, the influence of benthic algae on water quality can be simulated 
under consideration of light intensity, extinction and water depth, nutrient 
and temperature conditions. The module seperates two algal groups: benthic 
diatoms and green algae. It can be switched on/off independently for individual 
water sections. For each of the sections, algal densities at the sediment 
[g biomass/m²] can be set for each section if the module is switched on. 

Output of the module are oxygen production, oxygen consumption [mg/l] and the 
total biomass of benthic algae [g/m²].

Details of the benthic algae module are described in the following sections

- \subpage lnk_albenth_prozesse : Explanation of the processes implemented 
   within the benthic algae module

- \subpage lnk_albenth_vars : List of formula symbols and variables

- \subpage lnk_albenth_umsetzung : Details on the code and its numeric 
   implementation
