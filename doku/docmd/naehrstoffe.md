Nutrients {#lnk_naehrstoffe}
==========

Carbon is the primary building material of organisms and thus "the currency" of 
many ecological models. Carbon is taken up from the water by primary producers
and is then available as biomass for higher trophic levels. 
The decomposition of organic matter makes the carbon available again, but 
depletes oxygen in the process. 
The estimation of this oxygen depletion is one of the main essential tasks of 
water quality modelling.

The primary producers do not only need carbon for growth, but also various 
nutrients. The turnover of the nutrients nitrogen, phosphorus and silicate, 
which are the most important nutrients by mass, are quantified in single 
modules:

- \subpage lnk_phosphor
- \subpage lnk_silikat

Silicate is only relevant for diatoms, since these algae build their outer 
shell from silicate.
