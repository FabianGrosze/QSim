Tracer {#lnk_tracer}
========

\warning The tracer module is currently being revised. The text is from an 
earlier version of the documentation.

Tracers are substances that can be detected even in very low concentrations. 
Tracers are used in hydrology to investigate the flow of surface waters. 
The tracers may already be present in the water body (e.g. chloride), 
or artificial tracers are added to the water body and tracked over time and 
space. 

In QSim, the tracer module is used to describe the behaviour of these inert 
substances in flowing waters. The mass exchange of conservative substances is  
determined only by dispersion and advection. Discharges and withdrawals along 
the waterway are taken into account via mixing calculations.

With this module, the flow behaviour in branched water networks or in the tidal 
range with upstream and downstream waves can be recalculated.
