Silicon is needed by diatoms (lat.: Diatomea) to build up their silicic shell 
and can be the limiting factor for their growth. 
Silicon is only bioavailable as silicate dissolved in water.
Silicate is primarily discharged into water bodies from sewage treatment plants 
and via diffuse sources. 
Currently, QSim only takes into account silicon uptake by planktonic diatoms. 
Resuspension from the sediment is switched off, it only accounts for a small
share of the concentration changes.

Further details on the module are described in the following sections:

- \subpage lnk_silikat_prozesse : Explanation of the processes implemented 
   within the silicate module

- \subpage lnk_silikat_vars : List of formula symbols and variables 

- \subpage lnk_si_umsetzung : Details on the code and its numeric 
   implementation
